# AI Albums

Ellie Kripal, ekripal2@unl.edu

## Abstract

In this project I used text-to-image to produce variations of popular albums, using prompts such as "Harry's House," "Melodrama," "Battle at Garden's Gate," etc. This produced the main images that will be used. Then, I used StyleGAN to produce the same generated images in the style of said albums by using the generated album as the content and the original album as the style.

## Model/Data

For each album, included is the generated image using Text to Image, the original album cover, the final album cover using StyleGAN, and a PDF of the StyleGAN Jupyter notebook.
