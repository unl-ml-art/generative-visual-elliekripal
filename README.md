# AI Albums

Ellie Kripal, ekripal2@unl.edu

## Abstract

In this project I used text-to-image to produce variations of popular albums, using prompts such as "Harry's House," "Melodrama," "Battle at Garden's Gate," etc. This produced the main images that will be used. Then, I used StyleGAN to produce the same generated images in the style of said albums by using the generated album as the content and the original album as the style.

## Model/Data

For each album, included is the generated image using Text to Image, the original album cover, the final album cover using StyleGAN, and a PDF of the StyleGAN Jupyter notebook.

## Code

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
